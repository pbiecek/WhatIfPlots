\title{Calculate Local Conditional Expectation profiles}
\usage{
calculate_profiles_lce(
  data,
  variable_splits,
  model,
  dataset,
  predict_function = predict,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{set of observations. Profile will be calculated for every observation (every row)}

\item{variable_splits}{named list of vectors. Elements of the list are vectors with points in which profiles should be calculated. See an example for more details.}

\item{model}{a model that will be passed to the \code{predict_function}}

\item{dataset}{a data.frame, usually training data of a model, used for calculation of LCE profiles}

\item{predict_function}{function that takes data and model and returns numeric predictions. Note that the ... arguments will be passed to this function.}

\item{...}{other parameters that will be passed to the \code{predict_function}}
}
\value{
a data frame with profiles for selected variables and selected observations
}
\description{
This function Local Conditional Expectation profiles
}
\details{
Note that \code{calculate_profiles_lce} function is S3 generic.
If you want to work on non standard data sources (like H2O ddf, external databases)
you should overload it.
