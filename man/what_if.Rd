\item{explainer}{a model to be explained, preprocessed by the 'DALEX::explain' function}

\item{observation}{a new observarvation for which predictions need to be explained}

\item{grid_points}{number of points used for response path}

\item{selected_variables}{if specified, then only these variables will be explained}
}
